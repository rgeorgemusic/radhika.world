    The Baltic sea meets the Arabian sea in this collaboration between Swedish folk
    and Indian classical music genres. The melancholic melodies of the Accordion
    accompanied by the reverberating rhythms of the Tabla creates in the listeners
    a feeling of oneness with nature.
    Ljungkrona-George is a collaboration between Larisa Ljungkrona
    (Gothenburg) and Radhika George (Kerala). The two met at Strisvara - a
    project that promotes the collaboration of musicians from various spheres of
    society and various genres of music. The duo debuted in India along with
    Strisvara playing at various venues and the collaboration continued with the
    duo working together and performing in Sweden.
